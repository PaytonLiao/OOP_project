# Gripper Experimentation Framework

This script simulates a series of gripper experiments using PyBullet, designed to test the grasping and lifting capabilities of different gripper models.

## Classes Overview

### `Gripper` (Abstract Base Class)
The `Gripper` class is the base for all gripper types. It defines the necessary methods for gripper operations:
- `grasp(target)`: Grasp the target object.
- `preshape()`: Prepares the gripper for grasping.
- `openGripper(position)`: Opens the gripper to a specified position.
- `getJointPosition()`: Returns the current joint positions of the gripper.
- `experiment_setup()`: Initializes the gripper in the 3D space.
- `lifting()`: Lifts the gripper after a successful grasp.

### `three_finger_gripper`
This class extends `Gripper` and implements the grasping mechanisms for a three-finger gripper. It includes:
- Grasp, preshape, and lift operations.
- A method for opening the gripper.
- Setup and joint position management.
- Visualizing the 3D space with debug lines.

### `experiment`
This class handles individual experiments, where a gripper performs a grasping and lifting task on an object. It includes:
- Spawning the object in the simulation.
- Checking whether the grasp was successful by comparing the objectâ€™s position before and after lifting.

### `BatchExperiment`
This class runs multiple `experiment` objects simultaneously. It supports:
- Initializing multiple experiments within a grid.
- Running the grasping operations for all experiments.
- Saving results to CSV files.

## Features
- Simulate various gripper types (currently supports a 3-finger gripper).
- Test object grasping and lifting success in 3D space.
- Automatically generate random positions and orientations for experiments.
- Save results to CSV for analysis.

## Usage

1. **Setting Up the Experiment**  
   Initialize the `BatchExperiment` class with parameters like the batch number, number of experiments, and gripper name. The class will handle the creation of the experiment environment and manage the PyBullet connection.

2. **Experiment Execution**  
   After setting up the experiment space, you can trigger the `batchGraspingOperation()` method to run multiple experiments and collect the results.

3. **Results**  
   Results are saved in a CSV file, with each row representing a gripper position and its grasp success (1 for success, 0 for failure).

## Requirements
- PyBullet (`pip install pybullet`)
- Numpy (`pip install numpy`)
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)

## File Structure
- `Robots/grippers/threeFingers/sdh.urdf`: 3-finger gripper model.
- `share/cube_small.urdf`: Object models for the experiments (e.g., small cube).
- `utils/thing.py`: Contains utility functions for the experiment (e.g., `Thing` class).

## Notes
- This framework assumes you are running PyBullet in either GUI or shared memory mode.
- You can extend it with additional gripper and object models.
